The Refreshment Room is operated by Blueberry Cafe and is set in a former railway building at Miller's Dale Station along the Monsal Trail.

The cafe menu offers a taste of the Peak District with a selection of hot homemade dishes including Peak District Burger, homemade soups, sandwiches, salads, lighter bites, homemade cakes, freshly ground coffees and loose leaf local teas.

Takeaway food is also available to buy from the cafe, why not take a picnic along the trail and stop off to the admire one of the many nature reserves or landmarks. Please see the [Monsal Trail information leaflet](https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/125579/monsal-trail-leaflet.pdf) to plan your day.

The Refreshment Room works hard to promote the Peak District and also to protect the local environment. All our takeaway disposables are compostable or 100% recyclable.

Our staff are trained to answer your questions about the local area and to offer advice about nearby walks, trails and the general locality.
