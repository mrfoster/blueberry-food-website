Blueberry Cafe at the Arc Leisure Centre offers an eat in or takeaway service, with menu options to suit all the family.

We pride ourselves with offering homemade items whenever possible and strive to ensure our suppliers are as local as possible.

Our takeaway disposables are compostable as we feel strongly about always striving to reduce any negative impact on the local environment.

We are delighted to be working in partnership with Freedom Leisure, please visit [www.freedom-leisure.co.uk/centres/arc-leisure-matlock/](https://www.freedom-leisure.co.uk/centres/arc-leisure-matlock/) to find out more.
