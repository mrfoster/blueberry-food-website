Blueberry Cafe at Castleton is situated inside Castleton's Visitor Centre, in the heart of the stunning Peak District. The cafe welcomes everyone including dogs with well behaved owners and muddy boots.

The cafe menu offers a taste of the Peak District with a selection of hot homemade dishes including Peak District Burger, homemade soups, sandwiches, salads, lighter bites, homemade cakes, freshly ground coffees and loose leaf local teas.

Takeaway food is also available from the kiosk window next to the Cafe, if you would like to grab something quick to take with you on one of the [beautiful nearby walks](https://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/things-to-do/activities/walking-and-hiking/10-great-walks-in-the-peak-district-and-derbyshire).

Blueberry Cafe is accredited with the Environmental Quality Mark which shows our ongoing committment to promoting the Peak District and also protecting the local environment. All our takeaway disposables are compostable and we no longer stock plastic straws, this is just one of the many initiatives we have in place at our cafe. Please visit the [EQM website](http://www.eqm.org.uk/peakdistrict/about-eqm.asp) to find out more.
